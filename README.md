# G4-Brems
A Geant4 Model of Bremsstrahlung or "braking radiation." In this model I will mimic the production of Bremsstrahlung by shooting electrons at a tungsten target and detect the energies of the resulting x-ray photons. 


# Measurements
- Electron energies = 6 MeV or 10 MeV based on the equation $U (V) = E_{electron} (eV)$ [1](#sources) In other words, a 6 MV beam of a linac would produce 6 MeV electrons.
- Electron beam width: 1 mm [2](#sources)
- From target to detector: 10 mm (need source)
